---

  From 01.01.2021, the Federal Law of 23.11.2020 No. 372-FZ "On Amending Part Two of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation regarding the taxation of personal income exceeding 5 million rubles for the tax period" (hereinafter - Federal Law No. 372 -FZ). The law provides for a special procedure for the application of tax rates for personal income tax, depending on the size and type of income, and also introduces the concepts of "main tax base", "set of tax bases", establishes lists of individual types of income, the set of tax bases for which is subject to personal income tax at various rates. Let's consider these innovations in detail.



### Tax base and a set of tax bases

  When determining the tax base, all income of an individual is taken into account, which he received both in cash and in kind, or the right to dispose of which he had, as well as income in the form of material benefits, determined according to the rules of Art. 212 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (clause 1 of Article 210 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation).

  In this case, the tax base is determined separately for each type of income, in respect of which different tax rates are established (clause 2 of article 210 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation).

  Federal Law No. 372-FZ invalidated par. 2 p. 2 art. 210 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. It contained a clarification, according to which the tax base for income from equity participation should be determined separately from other income, in respect of which the tax rate of 13% is applied (clause 1 of article 224 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation).

However, Art. 210 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation was supplemented with new clauses 2.1 - 2.3, which determine the procedure for the formation of aggregate tax bases.

Based on clause 2.1 of Art. 210 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, the set of tax bases, in respect of which the tax rate of 13% is applied (provided for in clause 1 of article 224 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation), includes the following tax bases, each of which is determined in relation to the income of individuals - tax residents of the Russian Federation separately:


`tax base for income in the form of winnings received by participants in gambling and lottery participants;`

`the tax base on income from operations with securities and from operations with financial derivatives;`

`tax base for REPO transactions, the object of which is securities;`

`tax base on operations of a loan with securities;`

`tax base on income received by participants in an investment partnership;`

`tax base for transactions with securities and for transactions with derivative financial instruments accounted for in an individual investment account;`

`tax base for income in the form of the amounts of profits of a controlled foreign company (including fixed income of a controlled foreign company);`

`the tax base for other incomes, in respect of which the tax rate of 13% is applied, provided for in paragraph 1 of Art. 224 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (main tax base) .`
